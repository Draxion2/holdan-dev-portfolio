## Description

This is my own personal development portfolio using the powerful front-end React. It demostrates the knowledge I have learned using React as a single page application (SPA).

## Purpose

This applciation demostrates what I have learned when using React as a SPA (single page application) as it never has to load any additional web pages even though when clicking through the navigation, it clearly changes the layout of the page.

## Installation

This app is already deployed to Github but these steps will instruct on how it can be installed.

* Clone the git repository to your own machine.
* Run `npm i` or `npm install` in the command line to install all needed packages.
* Run `npm start` to run the React application as it should open in your default browser.
